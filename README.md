## Overview

Seen is a social media platform that serves as an answer to "What if you started a social media platform with 10 followers, then woke up the next day with 1 million?". Users have two tiers of followers that are distinct from one another - fixed/flux followers and following. Each day, flux followers are redistributed among the user base randomly; one user might get 80% of the user base as part of their flux followers, another 60%, and so on. 

Many people who use social media want to know what it might be like to have a massive following - for some it's a matter of being able to display their creative talents to an audience that might take years of hard work, luck, and persistence to achieve with conventional social media platforms. Others might want to know what it's like to be Seen by so many people. 

If a User is deemed viral and hold onto a large flux following for the day, their following has the opportunity to see this viral User's content then decide if they wish to keep up with them, in which case they choose to follow them and become a part of their fixed followers, which will never be redistributed or altered unless the user decides to unfollow. 


## Features

- UI that accesses data from [our backend repo](https://github.com/seenteam/seen-be) to generate a social media experience that allows users to make posts, like and dislike posts, follow and unfollow users
- Every 24 hours, flux followers are distributed across the user base randomly so that each day there are new viral users that can experience a large audience
- Users are greeted by their Feed, which consists of posts from them, their fixed/flux following (who the user follows), and are ordered chronologically by most recent post
- Users can search for other users in database and visit their profile
- Users can see who the viral users are for the day
- Users can view their fixed/flux followers and following and visit each users profile from there
- User can make a new post that gets added to their feed, other users' (provided they are following) and their user profile
- User profile shows a User's fixed/flux followers and posts, along with their name and username
- A logged in user is able to edit their profile details
